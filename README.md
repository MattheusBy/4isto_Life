--------------------------------------------------------------------Description-------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to study and apply technologies and simulate a real commercial project. I have experience in dry cleaning of upholstered furniture and understand the tasks and functionality that are needed for such a site.

Main aims:
- The most realistic project
- Only necessary functionality
- Beautiful design without unnecessary details
- Completely finished and tested project

You can find a description of the company, examples of work on the index-page. The Process tab describes the product dry cleaning process. Price for each type of furniture is in the "prices" section. Through the form on the "get_price" tab you can send data for an accurate estimate of the cost of cleaning. The data will send to the telegram-bot and the manager will send of cleaning upholstery. At the "calendar"-page, you can find the cleaning schedule and choose the appropriate date and time for you. On the tab "contacts" you can find instant messengers for communication.
